 </span>
    <p>I was stirred to write a blog post after stumbling across an op-ed titled &ldquo;<a href="https://obj.ca/index.php/article/op-ed-forget-about-toronto-sidewalk-labs-build-smart-neighbourhood-ottawa-instead"><em>Forget about Toronto, Sidewalk Labs â€“ build a smart neighbourhood in Ottawa instead</em></a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I have been following Toronto&rsquo;s efforts at smart city development for the past 9 months (aka the Sidewalk Labs debacle), and was alarmed to read this same group might bring their bad behaviour to Ottawa.</p>

<p>Sidewalk Labs&rsquo; smart city in Toronto has woeful accountability (and its leaked plans are <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/15/news/alphabets-sidewalk-labs-was-secretly-considering-big-plans-toronto-neighbourhood">terrifying</a>), with high profile <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/10/20/privacy-expert-steps-down-from-advisory-role-with-sidewalk-labs.html">resignations</a> from <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/technology/sidewalk-labs-advisory-panel-member-saadia-muzaffar-resigns-citing-deep-dismay">leading tech experts</a>. And yet they continue to go forward. Explain why would anyone would want that for their city?</p>

<p>The op-ed author says that a data policy is necessary upfront (which I absolutely agree with) while in the same breath telling us we should &ldquo;inform these businesses they could start developing a smart community in Ottawa today&rdquo;. Seems like a contradiction there. A public data policy must be something that is carefully debated and not rushed through. It&rsquo;s exactly this kind of &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll figure it out as we go&rdquo; mentality that got Toronto into trouble. It opens the door for corporate definition and interference in policy (and <a href="https://medium.com/@biancawylie/sidewalk-toronto-gaslighting-toronto-residents-backfired-capacitys-built-and-power-s-shifted-77c455b150a3">gas lighting</a>).</p>

<p>Learning from Toronto&rsquo;s failure, and with many thanks to the citizens advocating in opposition there, here is what Ottawa can and should do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start working on privacy and data governance policies. Today! This needs to happen ASAP or we <em>will</em> get bullied by corporations into rushed or inadequate policies. This needs to be carefully debated and done so in a fully transparent way.

<ul>
<li>Do we have any smart city policies already? I couldn&rsquo;t find them.</li>
<li>Laughably, Ottawa&rsquo;s published <a href="https://documents.ottawa.ca/sites/default/files/smart_city_strategy_en.pdf">Smart City 2.0 Strategy</a> does not have a single reference to &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; or even &ldquo;data governance&rdquo; in its strategy. (Yes you read that correctly. I wish I was joking.). Really shows where the priorities are.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next, as a city let&rsquo;s first be explicit about what features we want from our smart city, and debate those features in a public setting. Not all &ldquo;smart&rdquo; technology is smart for society or the public as a whole. We should not give carte blanche to corporations to &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; neighbourhoods however they see fit, as if breaking neighbourhoods was even a good thing.

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s follow the principle of <a href="http://spacing.ca/toronto/2019/02/19/did-the-sidewalk-labs-plot-just-thicken-or-is-the-story-coming-to-an-end/">Consult first, then procure.</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you to OBJ for the balanced journalism in also including an article on the <a href="https://obj.ca/article/web-data-collected-smart-city-tech-stokes-privacy-fears">privacy concerns</a> surrounding smart city development.</p>
