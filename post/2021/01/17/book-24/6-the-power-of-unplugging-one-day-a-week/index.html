<p>In <em>24 / 6</em> Tiffany Shlain proposes an antidote to the burdens of the modern world with a &ldquo;Tech Shabbat&rdquo;, a one-day reprieve from screens of all kind. Rather than define it using a negative, Shlain focuses on the positive by promoting it as a day to do all the things you always wished you had time for. I believe many of us dream of such a possibility.</p>

<p>I heard about this idea from <a href="https://www.teamhuman.fm/episodes/ep-139-tiffany-shlain-unplugging-one-day-a-week-tribute-to-paul-krassner">Shlain&rsquo;s interview on the Team Human podcast</a> and was immediately excited about it. At the time of writing, I have completed my first Tech Shabbat with my family, and we&rsquo;re very happy with how it went. We lit a candle to emphasize the transition. Going to bed early, fancy breakfast, listening to music, reading, thinking, having long conversations, spending time outdoors, napping&hellip; it was glorious. I agree with Shlain when she says her Shabbat always feels longer than one day, it did for us.</p>

<p>As far as the book is concerned, I was underwhelmed. I did find it useful to be shown specific examples of what Shabbat could entail, and I appreciated the emphasis on everyone defining their own rules and traditions in a way that works for them. Otherwise I found the book repetitive and the science chapters were not rigorous enough for my liking. In other parts I was finding it too autobiographical, I was not interested in the details&hellip; but then I realized that was actually the whole point of Shabbat! Shlain sees the Tech Shabbat as a technology, a tool that extends her purpose into the world and so it&rsquo;s quite impossible for her to talk about her Shabbat without also getting into her own goals and activities. And this insight turns it back onto the reader to decide (which I will do the same to you, dear reader):</p>

<p>What is your purpose? What are the things you always wished you had time for?</p>
