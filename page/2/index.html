      Music has a curious way of permeating your life, such that years later a song can stir up forgotten memories and emotions. Each song is precious in a way that only we can fully understand. These songs formed the soundtrack of my life in 2018. Black Violin - Stereotypes (album 2015) A mix of hip hop and classical, Black Violin pushes the boundaries of each genre. I&rsquo;ve actually been listening to this album for a couple years now and still not tired of it!

      This past December I discovered the Advent of Code challenge, in which you get a different coding puzzle for each day in December leading up to Christmas. The puzzles can be solved in any programming language of your choice. I decided to solve the puzzles in Elixir, which is a newer language that I am starting to use at work. The creator of Elixir, Jos√© Valim, was solving the puzzles as well and live streaming his solutions.

      This month I read Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman. In short, it is a story about how to live your best life. Perhaps because I had pre-internalized several of these ideas already from my own lived experience, I found the first half a slow and painful slog (also because I kind of loathed the main character, but that was mostly by design). It wasn&rsquo;t until around page 100 that I settled in and felt like I was getting something out of the book.

      It has been a busy time but I am still reading! Here is a quick recap of memorable books finished in Spring and Summer 2018. 49th Parallels Various authors (2017) Published during Canada&rsquo;s 150-year celebration, a compilation of short stories and alternative histories involving Canada and our place in the world. Example: what if Canada had been first to develop the atomic bomb? I supported this publication through crowdfunding, and am quite pleased with the result: uniquely Canadian!

      My Conversations With Canadians by Lee Maracle is a thoughtful journey across many topics central to Canada-Indigenous relations (or to use Maracle&rsquo;s suggested term: Canada-Turtle Islander relations). I loved this book. It was super approachable and a great education for a non-Turtle Islander like myself, challenging many preconceived ideas. Maracle recounts conversations she has shared with Canadians ranging in time from the 1970s to the present. She will often linger over questions posed to her by non-Indigenous Canadians, turning the question around for the reader and instead exploring the biases of the questioner - what assumptions do they already have in place, in order to even ask that question?

      Wrist by Nathan Niigan Noodin Adler Wrist is an Anishinaabe-inspired horror story that I picked up at the Ottawa Writersfest last year. One of the fun things about this book is that you&rsquo;re never totally certain if the monsters are real. Adler keeps you guessing about whether this is playing out in the imagination of Church, the protagonist, even going so far as to include other characters who themselves don&rsquo;t believe in the monsters.

      On Thursday I was invited by CSED to attend the Social Enterprise Unleashed conference in Ottawa. I had a great time and gained valuable insights into the social enterprise sector. Here are some key takeaways: Social procurement: Procurement generally follows the &ldquo;Lowest Price Wins&rdquo; model, which misses opportunities to benefit communities and can even cause harm by not respecting the environment nor paying living wages. The triple-bottom-line approach of social enterprise (People, Planet, Profit) needs to be the ultimate goal.

      A directory I have been helping to build for CSED has officially launched! RiseToTheOccasion.ca is a provincial directory of social enterprises for the event planning sector. If you&rsquo;re planning to put on an event in Ontario, you might like to see what&rsquo;s available, with over 80 enterprises currently listed. Expanding on the product delivered by our previous project (the Ottawa directory WeAllProfit.ca), the new directory adds the following enhancements: bilingual maps location-based searching administrative interface, so that individual enterprises as well as directory administrators can control content The directory was officially launched at the #SEUnleashed social enterprise conference in Ottawa on November 16th.

      The Dirt Cure by Maya Shetreat-Klein I read this book awhile ago with my wife, and wanted circle back and do a recap. The Dirt Cure argues that far from being something harmful to be avoided, dirt is actually rather healthy - more specifically, the microbes living in the dirt. This basic premise leads to insights into diet and illness. Dr. Maya‚Äôs philosophy is that the health of our inner terrain ‚Äîour bodies‚Äì is a reflection of the health of our outer terrain, the natural world around us.
