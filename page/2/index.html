      Wrist by Nathan Niigan Noodin Adler Wrist is an Anishinaabe-inspired horror story that I picked up at the Ottawa Writersfest last year. One of the fun things about this book is that you&rsquo;re never totally certain if the monsters are real. Adler keeps you guessing about whether this is playing out in the imagination of Church, the protagonist, even going so far as to include other characters who themselves don&rsquo;t believe in the monsters.

      On Thursday I was invited by CSED to attend the Social Enterprise Unleashed conference in Ottawa. I had a great time and gained valuable insights into the social enterprise sector. Here are some key takeaways: Social procurement: Procurement generally follows the &ldquo;Lowest Price Wins&rdquo; model, which misses opportunities to benefit communities and can even cause harm by not respecting the environment nor paying living wages. The triple-bottom-line approach of social enterprise (People, Planet, Profit) needs to be the ultimate goal.

      A directory I have been helping to build for CSED has officially launched! RiseToTheOccasion.ca is a provincial directory of social enterprises for the event planning sector. If you&rsquo;re planning to put on an event in Ontario, you might like to see what&rsquo;s available, with over 80 enterprises currently listed. Expanding on the product delivered by our previous project (the Ottawa directory WeAllProfit.ca), the new directory adds the following enhancements: bilingual maps location-based searching administrative interface, so that individual enterprises as well as directory administrators can control content The directory was officially launched at the #SEUnleashed social enterprise conference in Ottawa on November 16th.

      The Dirt Cure by Maya Shetreat-Klein I read this book awhile ago with my wife, and wanted circle back and do a recap. The Dirt Cure argues that far from being something harmful to be avoided, dirt is actually rather healthy - more specifically, the microbes living in the dirt. This basic premise leads to insights into diet and illness. Dr. Maya’s philosophy is that the health of our inner terrain —our bodies– is a reflection of the health of our outer terrain, the natural world around us.

      Do Not Say We Have Nothing by Madeleine Thien I confess this one took me a while to sink into. There came a point early on when I happened to pause the book and I almost never picked it up again. It sat there on my night table, a reminder, but I&rsquo;d find something else to occupy my time with. Eventually I did continue and I&rsquo;m glad for it. The story is a history of modern China told from the perspective of an everyday family comprising of artists and musicians.

      After years of remaining skeptical about password managers (do I really want to put all my eggs in one basket?), I finally caved after realizing that (a) there were simply too many accounts to remember and (b) my email is effectively a basket holding all the eggs already (anyone who gains access to your email account can use the password reset feature to access your other accounts). With that in mind a password manager didn&rsquo;t seem to increase my risk profile any further from it&rsquo;s current state.

      Martin Fowler wrote an article on software architecture almost 15 years ago. I just discovered it now while in the midst of changing jobs, and I found this part where he contrasts architect styles to be very relevant for me in this moment: Architectus Reloadus is the person who makes all the important decisions. The architect does this because a single mind is needed to ensure a system’s conceptual integrity, and perhaps because the architect doesn’t think that the team members are sufficiently skilled to make those decisions.

      For most people, myself included, ignorance is bliss when it comes to meat. We prefer to pick up our vacuum wrapped cuts from the grocery stores with only a cursory thought to its journey there. So it was with some trepidation that I picked up Project Animal Farm by Sonia Faruqi. It&rsquo;s the story of a Wall Street banker who followed her curiosity into the dark world of animal farming. It&rsquo;s a very personal journey and mainly anecdotal, which doesn&rsquo;t take away from it; in fact it enhances the connection with the reader.

      Last week, the US passed a law to ban refugees and Muslims. From a world that views America as a role model in freedom and opportunity, this is a shocking reversal on some core values. America is one of the strongest democracies in the world. If this can happen to America, then no country is safe. Here&rsquo;s what Canada can do today to avoid a similar eventuality down the road: Electoral Reform In my lifetime, the Canadian political experience has always included numerous political parties.

      A website I have been helping to build for CSED has officially launched! WeAllProfit.ca is a directory of social enterprises in Ottawa. A social enterprise is a venture which has a mission that goes beyond profit. This can mean offering employment to vulnerable or disabled people, protecting the environment, or passing their profits on to a charitable organization. Check out the website for many examples of social enterprises in Ottawa. This website will serve customers of the social enterprise sector by gathering all the local enterprises listings in one place, where a potential customer such as yourself can discover and browse the offerings.
